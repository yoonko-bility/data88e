    "The [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) is a classic game first discussed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher in 1950. In this game, there are two prisoners who have been captured and are being interrogated. The prisoners cannot contact each other in any way. They have two options: they can **defect** (betray the other prisoner to the police) or they can **cooperate** (maintain their silence). If both defect, both receive 4 years in prison. If one defects and the other does not, the defector goes free and the cooperator receives 5 years in prison. If both cooperate (meaning neither talks to the police), then they each receive 2 years in prison. We define **mutual defection** as the case when both prisoners defect and **mutual cooperation** as the case when both cooperate. The purpose of this game is to consider how a completely rational person would be best advised to proceed, and how different strategies for playing this game can be more or less effective.\n",

    "In this project, we will study the **iterated prisoner's dilemma**, a game paradigm in which the prisoner's dilemma is played over multiple rounds and in tournaments to determine the best strategy for playing the game. In this way, we define strategies as methods for determining whether a play will cooperate or defect at any single round based on this history of past moves. This differs from the normal prisoner's dilemma in that we play the game multiple times and incorporate strategies going beyond any single iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paradigm was introduced by [Robert Axelrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axelrod) to use the prisoner's dilemma as a lens through which to study the Cold War during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Axelrod created a tournament out of an iterated prisoner's dilemma and invited theoreticians to write programs that could strategically play the game, and then pitted them one against another in a round-robin-style tournament."

    "_Strategies like Backstabber and Grudger often score very high against their opponents. This is because these strategies have an aggressive nature, and tend to pursue their own interests even when the opponent cooperates. Tit For Tat shows relatively stable scores overall, and it seems to avoid major defeats because it adopts a strategy that responds to the opponent's actions. Considering these points, I think that choosing the Tit For Tat strategy will be advantageous for achieving stable results in the competition. Since Tit For Tat responds to the opponent's actions repeatedly, it can maintain balance by building trust between each other by cooperating when the opponent cooperates and betraying when the opponent betrays, or by taking revenge at an appropriate level. Therefore, I think the Tit For Tat strategy is a good choice because it allows you to act according to the opponent without taking unnecessary risks by acting aggressively._"

    "Now that we have the experience of creating prisoner's dilemma tournaments, let's consider Axelrod's findings. The [winning deterministic strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#Strategy_for_the_iterated_prisoner's_dilemma) was, surprisingly, tit-for-tat. This strategy was entered into the competition by [Anatol Rapoport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatol_Rapoport), coded in only four lines of BASIC. Axelrod studied the best strategies and came up with the following four traits of the biggest winners: niceness, retaliation, forgiveness, and lack of envy."

    "**Question 1.11:** In analyzing his tournament, Axelrod noted that one of the traits of the best strategies was being \"non-envious.\" A strategy that is non-envious does not strive to score higher than its opponent. Why do you think this trait is linked to good strategies? How does one of the other strategies you looked at (excluding defector, cooperator, and tit-for-tat) embody this trait?\n"

    "_\"Non-envious\" means that you do not try to get a higher score than your opponent. The reason why this trait is associated with good strategies is that if you betray or act aggressively to get a high score, you will invite retaliation from your opponent, which will result in both of you being disadvantaged. Therefore, it is better to cooperate while maintaining balance rather than trying to win more than your opponent. One strategy with the non-envious trait is Forgiver. Forgiver initially cooperates and continues to cooperate until the opponent defects more than a certain percentage. This strategy is non-envious because it tries to maintain balance with its opponent and does not try to get a higher score than its opponent. By doing so, it can achieve better long-term results by cooperating with its opponent._"

    "**Question 1.12:** The prisoner's dilemma is often used by economists to study and understand different phenomena that are observed in economies at different scales (e.g. studying oligopolies). Another common economic application is studying advertising and how the advertising of other firms needs to be taken into account in a single firm's advertising strategies. Describe how firms in an advertising space can be viewed as players in an iterated prisoner's dilemma. What decisions are analogous to defection and cooperation? What are the payoffs of each?\n"

    "_When considering the companies in the advertising market as a prisoner's dilemma, each company has two choices: advertising (defect) and not advertising (cooperate). If each company advertises to gain more market share, this is defect. In this case, other companies will also advertise, and eventually everyone will spend money, but the market share may not change much. This can lead to a loss for both parties. If the companies cooperate with each other and do not advertise, they can reduce advertising costs, and thus the cost-saving effect will appear. This means that there is a benefit through mutual cooperation._"
